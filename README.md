Make sure your previous C# project is closed. 
Then open this project and press start to run project in interactive mode.
To exit interactive mode press Ctrl+C

To run project in file mode of operation create file paramater.txt inside directory C:\test\
ie) C:\test\paramater.txt
In SmallerProject folder file program.cs On line 40 change the boolean fileModeOfOperation to false;

in file paramater.txt please write a list of algebraic equations to solve in each line such as: 
x^2+3.5xy+y=y^2-xy+y
x^2+3(x^2)(y^2)=y^2+4xy 
x^4+3(x^2)(y^2)z-y^2-0.5xy^2+1.5y(x^3)=y^2+4xy 
y^3(x^2)z-4z^3(x^2)+xyz=xyz-z^234-x
0.3x^2(z)-0.1y=0.3y-0.8(x^2)z
9.4x-0.4y-0.1xyz=-9.9x^2+6.7y+9.93xyz
 after creating this input paramater file, run the program by pressing start in visual studio. 
Solutions will automatically be created in mydoc.out in C:\test\mydoc.out directory"
