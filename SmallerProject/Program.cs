//Welcoime to my test assignment for News360! Today I'll be your host: Joe Bhullar 403-701-9561
//This program is:
//A Console Application for transofrming an input equation into Canonical Form.
//For Example:                           
//              input equation x^2+3.5xy+y=y^2-xy+y
//                 Solution:  (x^2)+4.5xy-(y^2)= 0   

//              input equation x^2+3(x^2)(y^2)=y^2+4xy 
//                 Solution:  (x^2)+3(x^2)(y^2)-(y^2)-4xy= 0 
//
//This program also has two seperate modes of operation. It has a File mode and a Console Interactive mode.
//SET line 40 bool fileModeOfOperation = true For File Mode
//SET line 40 bool fileModeOfOperation = false For Interactive Mode
//For File mode:*****************************************************************************
//               input file equations are in this directory and file "C:\test\paramater.txt"
//                *the input file, paramater.txt, contains lines with equations. 
//                  with each equation on a seperate line.
//                *Solutions to the equation will be Appended to the output file, mydoc.out!
//               output file solution equations are in directory and file "C:\test\mydoc.out"
//For Interactive mode:**********************************************************************
//              the application prompts user to enter equation and display result on enter.
//              this is repeated until the user presses Ctrl+C on the keyboard.

//        Assumption: Algebraic equation entries are entered in the same way as in example above.
